# QuickTS's own assertions (the per-repo block below): whether tailscaled is
# reachable at all. This script must pass either way — a developer with no
# Tailscale installed still has to be able to run `just test-live` — so it
# only notes which mode it ran in; scripts/localapi-check.sh is what actually
# probes modules/io.js against a live daemon, run separately by `live-extra`.

# This needs a real gnome-shell and so runs locally only; GitHub's runners have

# per-repo block is the same in every extension; the block holds what only
# this one checks. Keep the frame in step by hand.

# fixed points; leave a hook as `:` when there is nothing to do there.
#
# before_shell  — after the extension is installed, before gnome-shell starts:
#                 fixtures, settings (`gsettings --schemadir "$EXT_DIR/schemas"`).
# after_enable  — once the first "[$NAME] enabled" is logged.
# after_reenable — once the second "[$NAME] enabled" is logged.
# final_checks  — after the shared error and warning greps.
#
# Helpers available: wait_for PATTERN [COUNT], fail MESSAGE, and HELPER_PIDS
# for anything started in the background.

# Warnings this extension may legitimately log in a headless Shell, as one
# extended regex matched against the warning's text; empty allows none. None
# of modules/io.js's, modules/model.js's or modules/panel.js's console.warn
# calls fire on an ordinary enable/disable cycle, reachable daemon or not —
# every one guards a request nothing here makes (a click, a file chooser) or a
# state (a bad shortcut binding) this check never puts the Shell in.
